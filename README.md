# Random Color Picker
## Deployed on Netlify: https://js-color-picker.netlify.com

This assignment was a great introduction into the new hooks provided by React.js. Using useState and useEffect, I was able to create a custom color picker that allowed the user to set the hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha on the page. There is also a random color picker button that, when clicked, will randomize each of the four settings to produce a random color.

This assignment was initially a simple one-night homework, but because of the recent transition to React.js from JavaScript, it immediately caught my interest. While the original assignment only called for the addition of hue, saturation, and lightness, I grasped the concepts so well that I was able to meet the stretch goal of also adding the alpha/transparency selector.

One of the only areas that proved to be a bit of a struggle was using CSS and custom elements to handle the alpha/transparency setting with the background image. While not required, after the assignment was over, I sought out our instructor and worked with him to solve this problem. After fixing it, I was left with a better understanding of not only transparency but flexbox and even HTML element/page structure.
